# GMS Twist Myeloid pipeline
## Poppy
Poppy is a Snakemake pipeline used for analysing hybrid capture short-read sequencing data from the [Genomic Medicine Sweden](https://genomicmedicine.se/en/) myeloid gene panel. The pipeline analyses tumor-only samples and reports small variants, CNVs, as well as a QC report. It includes a reference pipeline used with normal samples to build the necessary files needed to run Poppy.
<!-- Somthing about that is it tested before releases? -->

## Gene Panel
The Twist Myeloid gene panel is a short-read capture panel designed for capturing common aberrations in Myeloid disorders which includes a comprehensive gene panel, a CNV backbone, and ID snps. The design is focused on clinical use but can also be used for research applications.
